# Folding the Unfoldable
## Using AlphaFold to investigate spurious proteins in AntiFam

In our study, we used AlphaFold2 [[1]](#1) in order to investigate spurious proteins in the AntiFam database [[2]](#2). This repository provides the sequence data as well as scripts used in our study. The AlphaFold structure prediction results are saved under the following link:
